Starting with moderate loads near 50% of capacity, the lifter executes repetitions with maximum explosive velocity, strictly ensuring a distinct muscular pause at the bottom to eliminate momentum and rebound. As weight increases incrementally each session, the repetition count naturally decreases from high ranges down to a threshold (typically 15 reps), triggering a cycle reset that drives continuous neural and hypertrophic adaptation.",
